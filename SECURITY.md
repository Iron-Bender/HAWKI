# Security Policy

We take the security of our projects very seriously. This means we aim to disclose and patch any arising issues as soon as possible. Moderate to major security issues will be fixed and included in a new release. Smaller issues will be given a hotfix.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to report a (possible) vulnerability, please create a report here with the GitHub Security Advisory Tool and include a description as detailed as possible as well as the steps to reproduce the issue. 
Alternatively you can contact us via E-Mail under vincent.timm2(at)hawk.de - please include the same information that you would fill in here on GitHub.

We will try to reply to your request within two weeks. You should expect a close collaboration as we work to resolve the security vulnerability you have reported. 
Please avoid revealing information about vulnerabilities in public without prior disclosure if that could put users at risk.

## Prefered Language
We prefer all communications to be in English or German.

## Attribution
We will include a "thank you section" in the project description for those who disclosed vulnurabilities in accordance to this policy.
After vulnurabilities are fixed a public disclosure is possible.
